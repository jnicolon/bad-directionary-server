My junior year at Weber State, I merged into a lane without looking and scraped against a school bus. Instead of stopping and talking to the driver, I had a panic attack and drove away as fast as I could. I sped through a yellow light and quickly turned left. I hid in a nearby parking garage. When I got out of my car, I noticed a tiny shard of glass on the roof, from what I assume was the bus’ rearview mirror shattering when I hit it. I put the glass shard in my backseat and ripped the magnetized “Weber State” bumper sticker off the back of my car. I’m not sure why I did that. I think I was worried that it’d make my car more recognizable if someone was out looking for it. I felt so guilty about what I had done, I called my friend Garth and asked if he’d drive me to the police station so I could file a report. I figured telling the truth would be better than being found out by someone else. A hit-and-run can lead to jail time, and I was prepared to deal with the consequences, which I thought might be lessened if I came forward. I filed the report, and made it as specific as possible. It’s been over ten years, and the police have never approached me. I’m assuming the statute of limitations has passed. I got away with something terrible, and I feel awful about it. Really, really awful. I wish I could apologize to the bus driver and tell them how sorry I am. It’s despicable. That’s not who I am and I hate myself for not being able to stop, take a second to breathe, and be an adult about it. I don’t really believe in God, but I believe in some sort of general force or feeling in the universe and I hope whatever that feeling is… well, I hope it can forgive me.

Not sure why they jump straight to O after the whole AB thing. I forget which one I am. I’m either Type A, Type AB, or Type O. I’m definitely not a B. Or wait, maybe I’m either B, AB, or O. I forget. Well, it doesn’t matter. I don’t think I’m gonna donate blood anytime soon. My buddy Brad Flynn was once on that show “Blind Date” (hosted by Roger Lodge) back in like 2003, and for some reason, his date took place at a blood bank. I think the show had just hired a new producer who chose a blood bank as a spot for the date, and that producer got fired like immediately after that. Seems kinda unfair. Brad said it went well and that he fingered his date at the end of the night and they went out on two more dates",
